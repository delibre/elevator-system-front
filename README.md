#### Control panel

![Control Panel](docs/control_panel.png)

To simulate a single step of the elevator operation, simply click on the "Simulate 1 Step" button.

For an automated simulation, use the "Run Auto Simulation" button. However, it's important to note that this feature may not function as expected. Unlike the step-by-step simulation with the "Simulate 1 Step" button, the auto simulation does not allow the user to add multiple call and destination floors simultaneously. Instead, it is limited to a predefined set of steps or predefined scenarios.
